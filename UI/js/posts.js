        message: '<p>I should nuance the following with a note: not all organisations make it easy for software engineers to do their job well.</p> All the advice below comes with a big caveat: if management doesn\’t do their job right, or if the organisation doesn\’t see the value of good software engineering practices, chances are you won\’t be able to be a great software engineer. That\’s a much deeper issue, and not necessarily something you can fix (aside from changing jobs, if that\’s in the realm of possibility for you). Also, a lot of this advice doesn\’t apply to solo developers. Without further ado, here are a few critical soft skills I\’d expect from a great software engineer.',

        message: 'To be successful today – in a world that is changing fast – we need to be able to consistently and efficiently adapt and grow. To achieve this we need to become a self-directed, lifelong learner. The key is discovering a love of learning. But learning doesn\’t just mean acquiring new knowledge. It\’s also about developing your skills, your attitudes, values, and your own way of being in the world.',
